# Smart Grocery Assistant with AI Agents & MCP üõí

**Automate your weekly meal planning and grocery runs**‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre all a bit lazy sometimes! This project uses OpenAI‚Äôs Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build friendly AI agents that:

- Track your pantry staples in Google Sheets
- Collect your meal plan for the week
- Figure out what you‚Äôre missing
- And (with a quick ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù from you) place the Instacart order!

## üöÄ High-Level Workflow

1. **Inventory Tracker Agent**  
   Kicks things off by asking your staple items (tomatoes, potatoes, milk, etc.) and saving counts to a `Inventory` sheet.  
2. **Meal Planner Agent**  
   Walks you through each day‚Äôs meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner), writing your answers into a `Meals` sheet.  
3. **Shopping Cart Generator**  
   Breaks down each dish into ingredients, diffs against your inventory, and spits out a `ShoppingCart_<YYYY-WW>` sheet with missing items.  
4. **Review & Order Agent**  
   Emails you the shopping cart for a quick review. On a üëç reply, it hits the Instacart API to build your cart at your favorite store and sends you the confirmation link.  
5. **Scheduler**  
   Fires everything off on your schedule (e.g. every Friday at 10 AM).
